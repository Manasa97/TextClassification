Enter unk King of Denmarke , Gertrude the Queene , Hamlet , Polonius , Laertes , and his Sister Ophelia , Lords Attendant . King . Though yet of Hamlet our deere Brothers death The memory be greene : and that it vs unk To beare our hearts in greefe , and our whole Kingdome To be unk in one brow of woe : Yet so farre hath Discretion unk with Nature , That we with wisest sorrow thinke on him , Together with remembrance of our selues . Therefore our sometimes Sister , now our Queene , Th ' unk unk of this warlike State , Haue we , as ' twere , with a unk ioy , With one unk , and one unk eye , With mirth in Funerall , and with unk in Marriage , In equall Scale unk unk and unk unk to Wife ; nor haue we heerein unk ' d Your better unk , which haue freely gone With this affaire along , for all our Thankes . Now followes , that you know young Fortinbras , unk a weake unk of our unk ; Or thinking by our late deere Brothers death , Our State to be unk , and out of Frame , unk with the dreame of his unk ; He hath not unk ' d to unk vs with unk , Importing the unk of those Lands unk by his Father : with all unk of Law To our most valiant Brother . So much for him . Enter Voltemand and Cornelius . Now for our selfe , and for this time of meeting Thus much the businesse is .

You told vs of some suite . What is ' t Laertes ? You cannot speake of Reason to the Dane , And loose your voyce . What would ' st thou unk Laertes , That shall not be my unk , not thy unk ? The Head is not more Natiue to the Heart , The unk more unk to the unk , Then is the Throne of Denmarke to thy Father . What would ' st thou haue Laertes ? Laer . unk my Lord , Your leaue and fauour to returne to France , From unk , though willingly I came to Denmarke To shew my duty in your unk , Yet now I must confesse , that duty done , My thoughts and unk bend againe towards France , And unk them to your gracious leaue and pardon King . Haue you your Fathers leaue ? What sayes unk ? Pol . He hath my Lord : I do beseech you giue him leaue to go King . Take thy faire houre Laertes , time be thine , And thy best unk unk it at thy will : But now my Cosin Hamlet , and my Sonne ? Ham . A little more then unk , and lesse then kinde King . How is it that the unk still hang on you ? Ham . Not so my Lord , I am too much i ' th ' Sun Queen . Good Hamlet cast thy nightly colour off , And let thine eye looke like a Friend on Denmarke . Do not for euer with thy unk unk unk for thy Noble Father in the dust ; Thou know ' st ' tis common , all that liues must dye , unk through Nature , to unk Ham . I Madam , it is common Queen . If it be ; Why seemes it so particular with thee Ham . Seemes Madam ? Nay , it is : I know not Seemes : ' Tis not alone my unk unk ( good Mother ) Nor unk unk of solemne Blacke , Nor unk unk of forc ' d breath , No , nor the unk unk in the Eye , Nor the unk unk of the unk , Together with all Formes , unk , shewes of unk , That can unk me truly . These indeed unk , For they are unk that a man might play : But I haue that Within , which unk show ; These , but the unk , and the unk of woe King . ' Tis sweet and unk In your Nature Hamlet , To giue these unk unk to your Father : But you must know , your Father lost a Father , That Father lost , lost his , and the unk bound In unk Obligation , for some terme To do unk Sorrow . But to unk In unk unk , is a course Of unk unk . ' Tis unk greefe , It shewes a will most unk to Heauen , A Heart unk , a Minde unk , An unk unk , and unk ' d : For , what we know must be , and is as common As any the most vulgar thing to sence , Why should we in our unk unk Take it to heart ? Fye , ' tis a fault to Heauen , A fault against the Dead , a fault to Nature , To Reason most absurd , whose common Theame Is death of Fathers , and who still hath cried , From the first Coarse , till he that dyed to day , This must be so . We pray you throw to earth This unk woe , and thinke of vs As of a Father ; For let the world take note , You are the most unk to our Throne , And with no lesse unk of Loue , Then that which unk Father beares his Sonne , Do I impart towards you . For your intent In going backe to unk in Wittenberg , It is most unk to our desire : And we beseech you , bend you to unk Heere in the cheere and unk of our eye , Our unk Courtier Cosin , and our Sonne Qu . Let not thy Mother lose her unk Hamlet : I prythee stay with vs , go not to Wittenberg Ham . I shall in all my best unk you Madam King . Why ' tis a louing , and a faire unk , Be as our selfe in Denmarke . Madam come , This gentle and unk ' d unk of Hamlet unk smiling to my heart ; in grace unk , No unk health that Denmarke drinkes to day , But the great Cannon to the unk shall tell , And the Kings unk , the Heauens shall bruite againe , unk unk Thunder . Come away . Exeunt . Manet Hamlet . Ham . Oh that this too too unk Flesh , would melt , unk , and unk it selfe into a unk : Or that the unk had not fixt His Cannon ' gainst Selfe - slaughter . O God , O God ! How weary , unk , flat , and unk Seemes to me all the vses of this world ? unk on ' t ? Oh fie , fie , ' tis an unk Garden That growes to unk : Things unk , and grosse in Nature unk it meerely . That it should come to this : But two unk dead : Nay , not so much ; not two , So excellent a King , that was to this unk to a unk : so louing to my Mother , That he might not unk the windes of heauen unk her face too unk . Heauen and Earth Must I remember : why she would hang on him , As if unk of unk had growne By what is unk on ; and yet within a unk ? Let me not thinke on ' t : unk , thy name is woman . A little unk , or ere those unk were old , With which she followed my poore Fathers body Like unk , all teares . Why she , euen she . ( O Heauen ! A unk that wants discourse of Reason Would haue unk ' d longer ) married with mine Vnkle , My Fathers Brother : but no more like my Father , Then I to Hercules . Within a unk ? Ere yet the salt of most unk Teares Had left the unk of her unk eyes , She married . O most wicked speed , to post With such unk to unk unk : It is not , nor it cannot come to good . But breake my heart , for I must hold my tongue . Enter Horatio , Barnardo , and Marcellus . Hor . unk to your Lordship Ham . I am glad to see you well : Horatio , or I do forget my selfe Hor .

I am very glad to see you : good euen Sir . But what in faith make you from unk ? Hor . A unk disposition , good my Lord Ham . I would not haue your Enemy say so ; Nor shall you doe mine eare that violence , To make it unk of your owne report Against your selfe . I know you are no unk : But what is your affaire in unk ? Wee ' l teach you to drinke deepe , ere you unk Hor . My Lord , I came to see your Fathers Funerall Ham . I pray thee doe not mock me ( fellow unk ) I thinke it was to see my Mothers unk Hor . Indeed my Lord , it followed hard vpon Ham . Thrift thrift Horatio : the Funerall unk - unk Did coldly unk forth the Marriage Tables ; Would I had unk my unk unk in heauen , Ere I had euer seene that day Horatio . My father , me thinkes I see my father Hor . Oh where my Lord ? Ham . In my minds eye ( Horatio ) Hor . I saw him once ; he was a goodly King Ham . He was a man , take him for all in all : I shall not look vpon his like againe Hor . My Lord , I thinke I saw him unk Ham . unk ? Who ? Hor . My Lord , the King your Father Ham . The King my Father ? Hor . Season your admiration for a while With an unk eare ; till I may deliuer Vpon the unk of these Gentlemen , This unk to you Ham . For Heauens loue let me heare Hor . unk nights together , had these Gentlemen ( Marcellus and Barnardo ) on their Watch In the dead unk and middle of the night unk thus unk . A figure like your Father , Arm ' d at all points unk , Cap a unk , unk before them , and with unk march unk slow and unk : By them thrice he unk , By their unk and feare - unk eyes , Within his unk length ; whilst they unk ' d unk to unk with the Act of feare , Stand dumbe and speake not to him . This to me In dreadfull unk impart they did , And I with them the third Night kept the Watch , unk they had deliuer ' d both in time , Forme of the thing ; each word made true and good , The Apparition comes . I knew your Father : These hands are not more like Ham . But where was this ? Mar . My Lord vpon the unk where we unk Ham . Did you not speake to it ? Hor . My Lord , I did ; But answere made it none : yet once me thought It unk vp it head , and did unk It selfe to motion , like as it would speake : But euen then , the unk Cocke crew lowd ; And at the sound it unk in hast away , And unk from our sight Ham . Tis very strange Hor . As I doe liue my unk Lord ' tis true ; And we did thinke it writ downe in our duty To let you know of it Ham . Indeed , indeed unk ; but this troubles me . Hold you the watch to Night ? Both . We doe my Lord Ham . Arm ' d , say you ? Both . Arm ' d , my Lord Ham . From top to toe ? Both . My Lord , from head to foote Ham . Then saw you not his face ? Hor . O yes , my Lord , he unk his unk vp Ham . What , lookt he unk ? Hor . A countenance more in sorrow then in unk Ham . Pale , or red ? Hor . Nay very pale Ham . And fixt his eyes vpon you ? Hor . Most unk Ham . I would I had beene there Hor . It would haue much unk ' d you Ham . Very like , very like : staid it long ? Hor . unk one with unk hast might tell a hundred All . unk , longer Hor . Not when I saw ' t Ham . His Beard was unk ? no Hor . It was , as I haue seene it in his life , A Sable unk ' d Ham . Ile watch to Night ; perchance ' twill wake againe Hor . I warrant you it will Ham . If it assume my unk Fathers person , Ile speake to it , though Hell it selfe should unk And bid me hold my peace . I pray you all , If you haue hitherto unk this sight ; Let it bee unk in your silence still : And unk els shall unk to night , Giue it an vnderstanding but no tongue ; I will unk your loues ; so fare ye well : Vpon the unk twixt unk and twelue , Ile visit you All . Our duty to your Honour . Exeunt Ham . Your loue , as mine to you : farewell . My Fathers Spirit in Armes ? All is not well : I doubt some foule play : would the Night were come ; Till then sit still my soule ; foule unk will rise , Though all the earth unk them to mens unk . Enter . Scena unk Enter Laertes and Ophelia . Laer . My unk are unk ' t ; Farewell : And Sister , as the unk giue unk , And unk is unk ; doe not sleepe , But let me heare from you Ophel . Doe you doubt that ? Laer . For Hamlet , and the unk of his fauours , Hold it a fashion and a toy in unk ; A unk in the youth of unk Nature ; unk , not unk ; sweet not lasting The unk of a unk ? No more Ophel . No more but so Laer . unk it no more : For nature unk does not grow alone , In unk and unk : but as his unk waxes , The inward seruice of the Minde and Soule unk wide withall . unk he loues you now , And now no unk nor unk doth unk The vertue of his feare : but you must feare His unk weigh ' d , his will is not his owne ; For hee himselfe is subiect to his Birth : Hee may not , as unk persons doe , unk for himselfe ; for , on his choyce depends The unk and health of the whole State . And therefore must his choyce be unk ' d Vnto the voyce and unk of that Body , unk he is the Head . Then if he sayes he loues you , It fits your wisedome so farre to beleeue it ; As he in his peculiar unk and force May giue his unk deed : which is no further , Then the maine voyce of Denmarke goes withall . Then unk what unk your Honour may unk , If with too unk eare you list his Songs ; Or lose your Heart ; or your chast Treasure open To his unk unk . Feare it Ophelia , feare it my deare Sister , And keepe within the unk of your Affection ; Out of the shot and danger of unk . The unk Maid is Prodigall enough , If she unk her beauty to the Moone : Vertue it selfe unk not unk unk , The Canker unk , the unk of the Spring Too oft before the unk be disclos ' d , And in the Morne and unk dew of Youth , unk unk are most unk . Be wary then , best safety lies in feare ; Youth to it selfe unk , though none else neere Ophe . I shall th ' effect of this good unk keepe , As unk to my heart : but good my Brother Doe not as some unk unk doe , unk me the unk and unk way to Heauen ; unk like a unk and unk unk unk , the unk unk of unk unk , And unk not his owne unk Laer . Oh , feare me not . Enter Polonius . I stay too long ; but here my Father comes : A double blessing is a double grace ; unk unk vpon a second leaue Polon . Yet heere Laertes ? unk , aboord for shame , The winde sits in the unk of your saile , And you are staid for there : my blessing with you ; And these few Precepts in thy memory , See thou Character . Giue thy thoughts no tongue , Nor any unk ' d thoughts his Act : Be thou unk ; but by no meanes vulgar : The friends thou hast , and their unk unk , Grapple them to thy Soule , with unk of Steele : But doe not dull thy unk , with entertainment Of each unk ' t , unk ' d unk . unk Of unk to a unk : but being in unk ' t that th ' unk may unk of thee . Giue euery man thine eare ; but few thy voyce : Take each mans censure ; but unk thy iudgement : unk thy unk as thy unk can buy ; But not unk in unk ; rich , not unk : For the unk oft unk the man . And they in France of the best unk and unk , Are of a most unk and generous unk in that . Neither a unk , nor a unk be ; For unk oft unk both it selfe and friend : And unk unk the edge of unk . This aboue all ; to thine owne selfe be true : And it must follow , as the Night the Day , Thou canst not then be false to any man . Farewell : my unk season this in thee Laer . Most humbly doe I take my leaue , my Lord Polon . The time unk you , goe , your seruants tend Laer . Farewell Ophelia , and remember well What I haue said to you Ophe . Tis in my memory unk , And you your selfe shall keepe the unk of it Laer . Farewell . Exit Laer . Polon . What ist Ophelia he hath said to you ? Ophe . So please you , somthing touching the unk [ unk ]. Hamlet Polon . Marry , well unk : Tis told me he hath very oft of late unk unk time to you ; and you your selfe Haue of your audience beene most free and unk . If it be so , as so tis put on me ; And that in way of unk : I must tell you , You doe not vnderstand your selfe so unk , As it unk my Daughter , and your Honour . What is betweene you , giue me vp the truth ? Ophe . He hath my Lord of late , made many tenders Of his affection to me Polon . Affection , unk . You speake like a greene unk , unk in such unk Circumstance . Doe you beleeue his tenders , as you call them ? Ophe . I do not know , my Lord , what I should thinke Polon . Marry Ile teach you ; thinke your selfe a Baby , That you haue tane his tenders for true pay , Which are not unk . unk your selfe more unk ; Or not to crack the winde of the poore Phrase , unk it thus , you ' l tender me a foole Ophe . My Lord , he hath unk ' d me with loue , In unk fashion Polon . I , fashion you may call it , go too , go too Ophe . And hath giuen countenance to his speech , My Lord , with all the vowes of Heauen Polon . I , unk to catch unk . I doe know When the unk burnes , how Prodigall the Soule Giues the tongue vowes : these unk , Daughter , Giuing more light then heate ; unk in both , Euen in their promise , as it is a making ; You must not take for fire . For this time Daughter , Be unk unk of your Maiden presence ; Set your unk at a unk unk , Then a command to unk . For Lord Hamlet , Beleeue so much in him , that he is young , And with a unk unk may he walke , Then may be giuen you . In few , Ophelia , Doe not beleeue his vowes ; for they are unk , Not of the eye , which their unk show : But meere unk of unk unk , unk like unk and pious unk , The better to beguile . This is for all : I would not , in unk tearmes , from this time forth , Haue you so unk any moment unk , As to giue words or talke with the Lord Hamlet : Looke too ' t , I charge you ; come your wayes Ophe . I shall obey my Lord . Exeunt . Enter Hamlet , Horatio , Marcellus . Ham . The Ayre unk unk : is it very cold ? Hor . It is a unk and an unk ayre Ham . What hower now ? Hor . I thinke it unk of twelue Mar . No , it is strooke Hor . Indeed I heard it not : then it drawes neere the season , Wherein the Spirit held his wont to walke . What does this meane my Lord ? Ham . The King doth wake to night , and takes his unk , Keepes unk and the unk unk unk , And as he unk his unk of Renish downe , The unk unk and Trumpet thus unk out The unk of his unk unk . Is it a custome ? Ham . I marry ist ; And to my mind , though I am unk heere , And to the unk borne : It is a Custome More honour ' d in the unk , then the obseruance . Enter Ghost . Hor . Looke my Lord , it comes Ham . Angels and unk of Grace defend vs : Be thou a Spirit of health , or unk damn ' d , Bring with thee unk from Heauen , or unk from Hell , Be thy unk wicked or charitable , Thou unk ' st in such a unk shape That I will speake to thee . Ile call thee Hamlet , King , Father , Royall Dane : Oh , oh , answer me , Let me not burst in Ignorance ; but tell Why thy unk ' d bones unk in death , Haue burst their unk , why the unk Wherein we saw thee unk unk ' d , Hath unk ' d his unk and unk unk , To cast thee vp againe ? What may this meane ? That thou dead Coarse againe in unk unk , unk thus the unk of the Moone , unk Night unk ? And we fooles of Nature , So horridly to shake our disposition , With thoughts beyond thee ; unk of our Soules , Say , why is this ? wherefore ? what should we doe ? Ghost unk Hamlet . Hor . It unk you to goe away with it , As if it some unk did desire To you alone Mar . Looke with what unk action It wafts you to a more unk ground : But doe not goe with it Hor . No , by no meanes Ham . It will not speake : then will I follow it Hor . Doe not my Lord Ham . Why , what should be the feare ? I doe not set my life at a unk unk ; And for my Soule , what can it doe to that ? Being a thing unk as it selfe : It unk me forth againe ; Ile follow it Hor . What if it tempt you toward the unk my Lord ? Or to the dreadfull unk of the unk , That unk o ' re his base into the Sea , And there unk some other horrible forme , Which might unk your unk of Reason , And draw you into madnesse thinke of it ? Ham . It wafts me still : goe on , Ile follow thee Mar . You shall not goe my Lord Ham . Hold off your hand Hor . Be rul ' d , you shall not goe Ham . My unk cries out , And makes each unk unk in this body , As unk as the unk unk unk : Still am I cal ' d ? unk me Gentlemen : By Heau ' n , Ile make a Ghost of him that lets me : I say away , goe on , Ile follow thee . Exeunt . Ghost & Hamlet . Hor . He waxes desperate with imagination Mar . Let ' s follow ; ' tis not fit thus to obey him Hor . Haue after , to what issue will this come ? Mar . Something is rotten in the State of Denmarke Hor . Heauen will direct it Mar . Nay , let ' s follow him . Exeunt . Enter Ghost and Hamlet . Ham . Where wilt thou lead me ? speak ; Ile go no further Gho . Marke me Ham . I will Gho . My hower is almost come , When I to unk and unk unk Must unk vp my selfe Ham . Alas poore Ghost Gho . unk me not , but lend thy unk hearing To what I shall vnfold Ham . Speake , I am bound to heare Gho . So art thou to reuenge , when thou shalt heare Ham . What ? Gho . I am thy Fathers Spirit , unk ' d for a certaine terme to walke the night ; And for the day unk ' d to fast in unk , Till the foule crimes done in my dayes of Nature Are unk and unk ' d away ? But that I am forbid To tell the unk of my Prison - unk ; I could a Tale vnfold , whose unk word Would unk vp thy soule , unk thy young blood , Make thy two eyes like Starres , start from their unk , Thy unk and unk unk to part , And each particular haire to stand an end , Like unk vpon the unk unk : But this eternall unk must not be To eares of flesh and bloud ; list Hamlet , oh list , If thou unk euer thy deare Father loue Ham . Oh Heauen ! Gho . Reuenge his foule and most vnnaturall Murther Ham . Murther ? Ghost . Murther most foule , as in the best it is ; But this most foule , strange , and vnnaturall Ham . unk , hast me to know it , That with wings as swift As unk , or the thoughts of Loue , May unk to my Reuenge Ghost . I finde thee apt , And unk should ' st thou be then the fat unk That unk it selfe in ease , on unk unk , Would ' st thou not stirre in this . Now Hamlet heare : It ' s giuen out , that sleeping in mine Orchard , A Serpent unk me : so the whole eare of Denmarke , Is by a unk unk of my death unk unk ' d : But know thou Noble youth , The Serpent that did sting thy Fathers life , Now unk his Crowne Ham . O my unk soule : mine Vncle ? Ghost . I that incestuous , that unk Beast With witchcraft of his wits , hath unk unk . Oh wicked Wit , and Gifts , that haue the power So to unk ? unk to this unk Lust The will of my most seeming unk Queene : Oh Hamlet , what a falling off was there , From me , whose loue was of that unk , That it went hand in hand , euen with the Vow I made to her in Marriage ; and to unk Vpon a wretch , whose Naturall gifts were poore To those of mine . But Vertue , as it neuer wil be unk , Though unk unk it in a shape of Heauen : So Lust , though to a unk Angell unk ' d , Will sate it selfe in a Celestiall bed , & unk on unk . But soft , me thinkes I sent the unk Ayre ; unk let me be : unk within mine Orchard , My custome alwayes in the unk ; Vpon my secure hower thy Vncle stole With unk of cursed unk in a unk , And in the unk of mine eares did unk The unk unk ; whose effect unk such an unk with bloud of Man , That swift as unk - unk , it unk through The naturall unk and unk of the body ; And with a sodaine unk it doth unk And unk , like unk unk into unk , The unk and wholsome blood : so did it mine ; And a most instant unk unk ' d about , Most unk - like , with unk and unk unk , All my smooth Body .

But woe is me , you are so sicke of late , So farre from cheere , and from your former state , That I distrust you : yet though I distrust , unk you ( my Lord ) it nothing must : For unk Feare and Loue , holds quantitie , In neither ought , or in unk : Now what my loue is , proofe hath made you know , And as my Loue is unk ' d , my Feare is so King . Faith I must leaue thee Loue , and shortly too : My unk Powers my unk leaue to do : And thou shalt liue in this faire world behinde , Honour ' d , unk ' d , and unk , one as kinde .

Most necessary ' tis , that we forget To pay our selues , what to our selues is unk : What to our selues in passion we unk , The passion unk , doth the purpose lose . The violence of other Greefe or Ioy , Their owne unk with themselues destroy : Where Ioy most unk , Greefe doth most lament ; Greefe ioyes , Ioy unk on unk accident . This world is not for unk , nor ' tis not strange That euen our Loues should with our Fortunes change . For ' tis a question left vs yet to proue , Whether Loue lead Fortune , or else Fortune Loue . The great man downe , you marke his unk unk , The poore unk ' d , makes Friends of Enemies : And hitherto doth Loue on Fortune tend , For who not needs , shall neuer lacke a unk : And who in want a unk Friend doth try , unk unk him his unk .

Not that I thinke you did not loue your Father , But that I know Loue is begun by Time : And that I see in unk of proofe , Time unk the unk and fire of it : Hamlet comes backe : what would you vndertake , To show your selfe your Fathers sonne indeed , More then in words ? Laer . To unk his throat i ' th ' Church Kin . No place indeed should murder unk ; Reuenge should haue no unk : but good Laertes Will you doe this , keepe close within your Chamber , Hamlet return ' d , shall know you are come home : Wee ' l put on those shall praise your excellence , And set a double unk on the unk The unk gaue you , bring you in fine together , And wager on your unk , he being unk , Most generous , and free from all unk , Will not unk the unk ?

The sir King ha ' s wag ' d with him unk Barbary unk , against the which he impon ' d as I take it , sixe French Rapiers and unk , with their unk , as unk , Hangers or so : three of the Carriages unk are very deare to fancy , very unk to the unk , most unk unk , and of very liberall conceit Ham . What call you the Carriages ? Osr . The Carriages Sir , are the unk Ham . The phrase would bee more unk to the matter : If we could carry Cannon by our sides ; I would it might be Hangers till then ; but on sixe Barbary unk against sixe French unk : their unk , and three liberall unk Carriages , that ' s the French but against the Danish ; why is this impon ' d as you call it ?

I commend my duty to your Lordship Ham . unk , yours ; hee does well to commend it himselfe , there are no tongues else for ' s tongue Hor . This unk unk away with the unk on his head Ham . He did unk with his unk before hee suck ' t it : thus had he and mine more of the same unk that I know the unk age unk on ; unk got the tune of the time , and outward habite of encounter , a kinde of unk unk , which unk them through & through the most fond and unk unk ; and doe but blow them to their unk : the unk are out Hor . You will lose this wager , my Lord Ham . I doe not thinke so , since he went into France , I haue beene in unk practice ; I shall unk at the oddes : but thou wouldest not thinke how all heere about my heart : but it is no matter Hor . Nay , good my Lord Ham . It is but unk ; but it is such a kinde of unk - giuing as would perhaps unk a woman Hor . If your minde unk any thing , obey .
